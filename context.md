# Motherboard — Project Context

## Game Description
Top-down 2D puzzle game built in Godot 4.5. Players move freely (pixel-level WASD) through grid-based rooms, place "prong" objects to complete electrical circuits, push blocks to solve spatial puzzles, and open doors. The world is divided into discrete rooms; walking to a room edge smoothly pans the camera. Pressing R resets the current room with a CRT static effect. A splash screen is shown on launch.

## Grid & Coordinate System

```
TILE_SIZE    = 32 px
WORLD_OFFSET = 0         (tile grid starts at world origin)
ROOM_WIDTH   = 25 tiles
ROOM_HEIGHT  = 12 tiles
CAMERA_MARGIN = Vector2(16, 16)   (camera center offset from exact room center)
```

- **Tile top-left** in world space: `Vector2(col * 32, row * 32)`
- **Tile center** in world space: `Vector2(col * 32 + 16, row * 32 + 16)`
- **Room** `(rx, ry)` occupies columns `[rx*25 .. rx*25+24]`, rows `[ry*12 .. ry*12+11]`
- **Camera center** for room `(rx, ry)`: `Vector2(rx*800 + 400 + 16, ry*384 + 192 + 16)`
- Viewport is 800×384 — one room fills the screen
- Rooms support negative coordinates (room y can be negative); room detection uses `floori` to handle this

**Node position conventions (all objects):**
- **Player, Prong** — root `Node2D` position is the **hitbox bottom** (Y-sort key). A `Body` child is offset upward so sprites stay tile-centered; see Y-Sorting below.
- **PushBlock, Nut** → positioned at **tile top-left** (`col*32, row*32`); sprite at `(0, 0)`
- Door, FloorPanel, LightningBlocker, KeyDoor, Key, PassBlock → positioned at **tile top-left**
- **Enemy** → positioned at **tile top-left** (`col*32, row*32`); moves continuously from there

**Sprite origin convention:** All sprites use `centered = false` (top-left origin).
- Player / Prong: sprite on `Body` at `(-16, -16)` so it covers the tile when the body origin is at tile center
- PushBlock / Nut: sprite at `(0, 0)` on the root node
- Tile-top-left objects: sprite at `(0, 0)` fills the tile naturally
- Enemy: sprite at `(0, 0)`; visual lag tracked via `_visual_pos` lerp (sprite offset applied each frame)

---

## Y-Sorting (depth)

Godot Y-sorts by each node's `position.y` (higher Y = drawn in front). Walls use per-tile sort at **tile top** (`y_sort_origin = 0` on wall tiles).

**Setup (`Main._setup_y_sort_children()`):**
- `Walls` `TileMapLayer` has `y_sort_enabled = true`; `Main` does not
- At startup, gameplay nodes in `Y_SORT_GROUPS` are reparented under `Walls` (global transform preserved) so they sort in the same pass as wall tiles
- New prongs are spawned as children of `wall_tilemap` directly

**`Y_SORT_GROUPS`:** `players`, `prongs`, `doors`, `lightning_blockers`, `key_doors`, `push_blocks`, `pass_blocks`, `keys`, `teleport_panels`, `screws`, `enemies`

> **Rule:** Every new solid or interactive object added to the game must be added to `Y_SORT_GROUPS` (and `add_to_group` with a matching group name in its script) so it is reparented under `Walls` at startup and depth-sorts correctly against the player.

**Depth rule:** compare actor **hitbox bottom** vs solid **tile top**.
- Hitbox bottom below tile top (larger Y) → actor in front
- Hitbox bottom above tile top (smaller Y) → actor behind

**Player & Prong (`YSortHitboxBottom.gd`):**
- Root position = hitbox bottom (movement / Y-sort for player)
- `Body` child at `(0, -(hitbox_offset.y + half_h))` keeps sprite + hitbox in the original tile-centered layout
- `SPRITE_OFFSET = (-16, -16)` on `Body`
- Player hitbox: 10×10 on `Body`, offset `(0, 8)` → `_body_offset = (0, -13)`
- Prong hitbox: 8×8 on `Body`, offset `(0, 0)` → `_body_offset = (0, -4)`; placed via `setup(hitbox_center)`

**Other solids (doors, blockers, key doors, push blocks, etc.):** node at tile top-left; sort Y = tile top (same as walls).

**Not Y-sorted with walls:** `ElectricBeam` (`z_index = 10`), `FloorPanel` (`z_index = -10`), UI sprites, camera, overlays.

  YSortHitboxBottom.gd     — Hitbox-bottom Y-sort helpers (Player, Prong)
  MapOverlay.gd            — Map overlay UI (TAB to open); slides in/out from top; teleport mode requires push ability; title always shows "The Map" in both modes; pressing Space on the player's current room does nothing
  TeleportAnchor.gd        — Room teleport anchor markers (legacy fallback; TeleportPanel is now the primary teleport mechanic)
  TeleportPanel.gd         — Interactive teleport panel; closed=solid (player pushes 0.2s to open); open=passable floor; screenshake on open; exports panel_name (shown on map) and one_way (excludes from destinations)

  WaterBoss.gd             — Extends WaterEnemy.gd; 2× scale, 2000 HP; @export var debug_low_hp: bool sets HP to 10 at start if true; boss health bar via Utils (visible in boss home room when alive); takes 1 dmg/frame from beam (shake 1.0 + health bar shake+particles) + freeze-frame on first contact each exposure; teleports to random free tile (≥5 tiles from player, ≥2 tiles from room border) after 1.5s in beam; sprite slides to new position on teleport; speed scales with HP loss (BASE=40→MAX=100); spawns two WaterEnemy minions 3 tiles out below 80% HP with 0.7s scale-pulse telegraph (interval scales 4s→2s as HP drops, skips spawn if within 96px of player); charge attack: cooldown 3s, triggers when player within 5 tiles — 1s squash/stretch wind-up, then lunges at 240 px/s decelerating to normal speed; teleport mid-windup resets cooldown; phase 2 at 50% HP: screen shake + brief pause; death: series of 3 extreme shakes (0.5s apart), minion water_enemies in room deleted immediately (boss skips self in that loop), boss freezes 1s then arcs off screen in a parabola at z_index=100 with a slight rotation (dir * p * 0.8 rad) — doors open and particles fire once boss exits room bounds; sprite lag at half enemy speed (BOSS_SPRITE_SPEED=10); no modulation effects
  BossDoor.gd              — Solid tile object in "boss_doors" group only (NOT push_blocks — has no push() method); provides grid_pos/start_grid_pos computed from position; open() calls SaveManager.notify_boss_door_opened() then queue_free(); reset() also frees if already opened (permanent removal)
  TimedObject.gd           — Node2D that tracks per-room-visit time; sprite (arrow_up.png) appears after 120s if player lacks chain ability; blinks every 0.5s while visible; sets player.speed_multiplier=0.8 while showing; resets (hides, restores speed, clears timer) each time the player enters its room; always hidden after chain ability granted; requires Sprite2D child named "Sprite2D"

## Scripts

### GameManager.gd (autoload singleton)
**Purpose:** Central puzzle state manager. `evaluate_puzzle()` is driven solely by `Main._update_beam()`.

**Key variables:**
- `prongs: Array` — up to 2 entries, each `{node: Node, grid_pos: Vector2i}`
- `beam_blocked: bool` — set by Main before `evaluate_puzzle()`
- `floor_panels: Dictionary` — `Vector2i → Array[String]` (one or two IDs per panel)
- `doors: Dictionary` — `String id → Array[Node]`
- `_abilities: Dictionary` — `String → bool`; tracks granted abilities
- `signal doors_update(id: String, open: bool)`
- `signal shake_requested(strength: float)`
- `const PANEL_ACTIVATION_RADIUS := 24.0` — radius (px) for prong-to-panel proximity check

**Key functions:**
- `place_prong(node, grid_pos)` — appends entry
- `remove_prong(node)` — removes by node reference
- `clear_prongs()` → `Array` — clears all, returns removed for animation
- `clear_scene_state()` — clears prongs, doors, floor_panels, resets beam_blocked; called by SaveManager before scene reload to prevent stale node refs
- `evaluate_puzzle()` — opens doors if: not beam_blocked, 2 prongs on **different** panels sharing at least one id; guards prong node refs with `is_instance_valid()`
- `register_floor_panel(grid_pos, id, id2="")` — stores 1–2 IDs for a panel
- `_panel_near(world_pos)` → `Vector2i` — returns panel grid pos within activation radius, or `(-999999,-999999)`
- `grant_ability(ability)` — marks ability as acquired
- `has_ability(ability)` → `bool`
- `get_abilities()` → `Dictionary` — returns duplicate of `_abilities`; used by SaveManager
- `set_abilities(d)` — replaces `_abilities` from a dictionary; used by SaveManager on load
- `get_prong_positions()` → `Array[Vector2i]` — skips invalid nodes
- `get_prong_world_positions()` → `Array[Vector2]` — skips invalid nodes

---

### Main.gd (Node2D — root scene)
**Purpose:** Game world controller. Manages rooms, camera, prong spawning, reset, beam/blocker logic.

**Key constants:** `TILE_SIZE=32`, `WORLD_OFFSET=0`, `CAMERA_MARGIN=Vector2(16,16)`, `CAMERA_TWEEN_DURATION=0.25`

**Key variables:**
- `@onready var wall_tilemap: TileMapLayer` — assign in inspector; checked by `_is_static_solid()` / `get_player_blocking_rects()`
- `current_room: Vector2i`
- `room_entry_positions: Dictionary`
- `_shake_amount: float` — camera shake magnitude
- `ability_message: Node` — `AbilityMessage` CanvasLayer instance; exposed for `AbilityPickup` to call `show_message()`

**Key functions:**
- `_setup_y_sort_children()` — enables Y-sort on `Walls`, reparents `Y_SORT_GROUPS` nodes under `wall_tilemap`. Screws are in `Y_SORT_GROUPS` and are reparented like other solids; they are also checked via `_is_static_solid()` using the `"screws"` group
- `_process(delta)` — shake decay → `camera.offset`
- `_trigger_shake(strength)` — sets `_shake_amount`; connected to `GameManager.shake_requested`
- `_update_beam()` — checks blockers, sets `GameManager.beam_blocked`, calls `evaluate_puzzle()`, activates/deactivates beam
- `spawn_prong(pixel_pos)` — `pixel_pos` is hitbox center; if 2 prongs already exist, oldest is removed with shrink animation before placing new one (no "clear both" behaviour)
- `_reset_room()` — locks player → ResetEffect fades in → awaits `peaked` → resets room state (prongs, push blocks, key doors, keys, enemies) → awaits `done` → unlocks player
- `_transition_to_room(new_room)` — clears prongs instantly, resets enemies in new room, tweens camera 0.25s
- `check_room_transition(player_grid, player_pixel)` — uses `floori` division; downward and rightward transitions require player pixel position to be 24px past the boundary before firing
- `tile_rect(grid_pos)` → `Rect2` — 32×32 world rect for a grid tile
- `_is_static_solid(grid_pos)` — walls, closed doors, lightning blockers, key doors, closed teleport panels, screws (NOT push blocks, NOT pass blocks)
- `is_blocked(grid_pos)` — static solids + push blocks (used for grid queries elsewhere)
- `can_teleport_from_panel()` → `bool` — true if player is on an open panel, at least 2 total open panels exist (including one-ways), and at least one non-one-way destination exists; used for TAB prompt and teleport mode activation
- `get_open_teleport_panel_rooms()` — returns rooms with open non-one-way TeleportPanels (destinations only)
- `get_player_blocking_rects(area)` → `Array[Rect2]` — static tile rects + push-block rects overlapping `area`; used by player and enemy AABB movement
- `can_push_block_to(grid_pos)` — false if static solid, push block, or pass block occupies tile
- `get_push_block_at_face(player_rect, dir, from_point)` → `Node` — among push blocks flush against `player_rect` on the given face, returns the one whose center is closest to `from_point`
- `has_pass_block_at(grid_pos)` — checks pass_blocks group
- `get_push_block_at(grid_pos)` → Node or null
- `_find_nearest_open_tile(start)` — BFS for nearest unblocked tile; uses `is_blocked` (includes push blocks)
- `is_player_on_active_teleport_panel()` → `bool` — true if player hitbox overlaps any open TeleportPanel
- `get_open_teleport_panel_rooms()` → `Array` — list of room coords that contain an open TeleportPanel
- `_get_open_panel_for_room(room)` → `Node` — finds the open TeleportPanel in a given room (used by `_on_teleport_requested`)
- `_on_teleport_requested(room)` — teleports to the open TeleportPanel in target room; falls back to TeleportAnchor if none
- `_update_tab_label()` — shows "TAB" Label above player sprite when on open panel with ≥2 open panels; color matches `modulate`; position tracks `player.visual_pos`

---

### Player.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Free pixel-based movement, push input, and prong placement.

**Constants:** `SPEED=217.6 px/s` (20% reduced from original 272), `SPRITE_SPEED=24.0`, `CONTACT_EPS=0.1`, `PUSH_FREEZE=0.15`

**Scene structure:** Root `Node2D` (script) → `Body` → `Sprite2D` + `Hitbox`. Root `position` = **hitbox bottom** (Y-sort + movement anchor). `Body` holds visuals/collision at tile-centered layout.

**Hitbox:** `Body/Hitbox` `CollisionShape2D`, `RectangleShape2D` 10×10 at `(0, 8)`. Read in `_ready()` via `YSortHitboxBottom.read_hitbox()`; `_body_offset` computed so hitbox bottom sits on root origin.

**Movement (AABB collision):** Root `position` is hitbox bottom. `_hitbox_rect(pos)` = `pos + _body_offset + _hitbox_offset`. Axis-separated movement against `Main.get_player_blocking_rects()`. Squash/stretch on dominant axis. Pass blocks are not solids.

**Push detection:** After movement; single cardinal input; flush against push-block face. Closest block by `_sprite_center()`. On success: `block.push(dir)`, shake (0.8), `PUSH_FREEZE` axis lock. Push is **gated** by `GameManager.has_ability("push")` — no pushing until that ability is acquired.

**Startup ability grants:** `@export var start_with_push: bool` and `@export var start_with_chain: bool` — if true, the corresponding ability is granted via `GameManager.grant_ability()` in `_ready()` without requiring a pickup.

**Save system:** `@export var save_system_enabled: bool = false`. If `false`, SaveManager auto-activates slot 1 and loads it on start. If `true`, the player manually picks a slot with 1–9. `SaveManager.on_player_ready(save_system_enabled)` is called at the end of `_ready()`.

**Key variables:** `speed_multiplier: float = 1.0` — scales movement velocity; set to `0.8` by TimedObject while it is visible, restored to `1.0` when it hides.

**Key functions:** `get_body_center()` → hitbox center world pos; `_hitbox_rect(pos)`, `_sprite_center()`, `_grid_to_world()` / `_world_to_grid()`, `reset_to(gp)`, `_try_push()`, `_start_push_lock(dir)`, `eject_from_solid()` — BFS from current grid pos to nearest free tile; called every frame in `_process` and at end of `reset_to`

**References `Main` via `get_tree().current_scene`** (not `get_parent()`), because the player is reparented under `Walls` at runtime.

---

### Prong.gd (Node2D)
- Group `"prongs"`; same `Body` / hitbox-bottom layout as Player (8×8 hitbox on `Body`)
- `grid_pos: Vector2i` — `floori(position.x / 32), floori(position.y / 32)` (root = hitbox bottom)
- `setup(pixel_pos)` — `pixel_pos` is hitbox center; root placed via `YSortHitboxBottom.root_pos_from_hitbox_center()`; sprite `(-16,-16)`; tweens scale `0 → 1.3 → 1`
- `apply_clear_shrink(s)` — shrink-to-center clear animation (called from `Main.spawn_prong()`)
- **Max 2.** Third press clears both, then deactivates beam

---

### Nut.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Pushable conductor. Identical push/reset behaviour to PushBlock (tile top-left node, `SPRITE_OFFSET = (0, 0)`) but also in `"nuts"` group. After slide tween, calls `Main._update_beam()` via `get_tree().current_scene`. `get_beam_point()` returns sprite center. `get_collision_rect()` → 32×32 world `Rect2`. Beam routes through Nuts only when `GameManager.has_ability("chain")`.

**Enemy interaction:** `push(direction)` checks for enemies whose center tile matches the new `grid_pos` and calls `enemy.push(direction)` on them, same as PushBlock.

---

### Screw.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Static conductor. Like Nut but cannot be pushed. In `"nuts"` group (beam routes through it when chain ability is acquired) and `"screws"` group (used by `Main._is_static_solid()` to block player and push blocks). Has `get_grid_pos()`, `get_beam_point()`, `get_collision_rect()`, `reset()`. Does NOT have a `push()` method and is NOT in `"push_blocks"` group.

---

### PushBlock.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Instantly teleports one tile when pushed; sprite slides to simulate smooth movement.

- Node at **tile top-left**; `SPRITE_OFFSET = (0, 0)`; `_grid_to_world(gp)` → `(gp.x * 32, gp.y * 32)`
- `_ready()` — infers `start_grid_pos` from editor placement, snaps to tile top-left
- `get_collision_rect()` → 32×32 world `Rect2` for player collision/push queries
- `push(direction)` — teleports node, slides sprite from old position; checks for enemies in new tile and pushes them; if highlighted, clears all highlights first
- `reset()` — restores `start_grid_pos`, snaps sprite, clears highlight
- `set_highlight(val)` — enables/disables the pulsing white border drawn via `_draw()`
- `_draw()` — when highlighted, draws an unfilled white rectangle around the block with a ±1px oscillating offset (`sin(time * PI)`, one cycle/s)
- `_clear_all_highlights()` — iterates `"push_blocks"` group; guards with `has_method("set_highlight")` to safely skip Nut nodes

---

### PassBlock.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Block the player can walk through freely, but push blocks and nuts cannot be pushed onto.

- Added to group `"pass_blocks"`; uses `switch_open2.png` sprite
- `get_grid_pos()` — used by `Main.has_pass_block_at()`
- NOT included in `Main.is_blocked()` — player passes through freely

---

### ElectricBeam.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Animated electricity visual. `z_index = 10`.

- Beam is **white**, fully opaque. Glow Line2D is hidden (`line_glow.visible = false`)
- Beam width pulses via `sin(time * 8)`. Endpoint glow circles drawn white in `_draw()`. `WOBBLE_SPEED = 19` (oscillates fast)
- All waypoint positions are offset by `Vector2(0, -4)` in `_resolve_waypoints()` so the beam renders 4px above each node's origin
- `activate(points)` — ordered list: prong A → nuts → prong B
- `deactivate()` — hides beam
- `is_point_on_beam(point, radius)` → `bool` — returns true if `point` is within `radius` pixels of any beam segment; used by Enemy to detect beam contact

### Door.gd (Node2D)
- `@export var id: String` — matches FloorPanel IDs
- `set_open(open)` — on open: emits `GameManager.shake_requested(5.0)`, brief white flash, then shrinks sprite toward its center over `ANIM_DURATION=0.15s` (scale + position compensated via `_apply_shrink_scale`) and hides; on close: starts at scale 0 centered, grows back to full size over 0.15s
- Added to group `"doors"`

---

### FloorPanel.gd (Node2D)
- `@export var id: String`; `@export var id2: String = ""`; `@export var positive: bool = true`
- Supports up to two IDs; both registered with `GameManager.register_floor_panel(gp, id, id2)`
- Added to group `"floor_panels"` in `_ready()`
- Sprite is hidden; drawn manually via `_draw()` so circle can render on top
- `_process`: checks if any prong is within `PANEL_ACTIVATION_RADIUS` (24px) of panel center; calls `queue_redraw()` on state change; ticks `_highlight_time` when highlighted
- `_draw()`: draws sprite texture; draws white circle outline (radius 17px) when active; draws pulsing white border (same as PushBlock) when highlighted
- `set_highlight(val)` — enables/disables the pulsing border
- Registers in GameManager with grid position

---

### LightningBlocker.gd (Node2D)
- Position = tile top-left; group `"lightning_blockers"`; solid (blocks player and push blocks)
- Sprite node hidden; texture drawn manually in `_draw()` with `draw_texture`
- `_draw()`: draws `resistor_small.png` normally; when blocking, alternates to `resistor_small2.png` every 0.5s using `int(_time / 0.5) % 2`
- Sparks drawn on top in same `_draw()` call
- `queue_redraw()` called in `_ready()` for initial render
- `get_grid_pos()` — `floori(position / 32)`

---

### KeyDoor.gd (Node2D)
- No id export — matches keys by room position (`floori(pos / 800 or 384)`)
- `_count_keys()` — deferred; counts all Keys in the same room
- `key_collected()` — increments counter; opens when all collected
- `_open()` — removes from group, emits `shake_requested(5.0)`, runs shrink-to-center tween (same as Door: scale+position compensated via `_apply_shrink_scale`, `ANIM_DURATION=0.15s`), then hides sprite permanently
- `reset()` — if opened, returns immediately; kills any in-flight tween, restores sprite scale/position/visibility, re-adds to group

---

### Key.gd (Node2D)
- No `door_id` export — notifies KeyDoors in the same room on collect
- Pickup range uses `player.get_body_center()` (hitbox center), not root position
- `_collect(player)` — notifies KeyDoors, then tweens toward `player.get_body_center()`
- `reset()` — only resets if a KeyDoor still exists in the same room (door not permanently opened); restores position, scale, sprite.position

---

### ResetEffect.gd (CanvasLayer, layer=20)
- Full-screen ColorRect with embedded GLSL shader: chunky 2px pixel noise, horizontal glitch bands, scanlines, bright flash bars
- `signal peaked` — emitted when static reaches 100% opacity
- `signal done` — emitted when fade-out completes
- `play()` — fades in over `FADE_IN=0.28s` → holds at 100% for 0.2s → emits `peaked` → fades out over `FADE_OUT=0.22s` → emits `done`
- Room state resets at `peaked`; player unlocks at `done`

---

### SplashScreen.gd (CanvasLayer, layer=30)
- Shown on game launch; black ColorRect + centered Label: "A Game By\nOliver T. Bates & CasterOil"
- Intercepts all input via `_input`; dismissed by any key/mouse/joypad press
- On dismiss: consumes the input event, unlocks player, frees self
- Player movement is locked in `Main._ready()` until dismissed

---

### AbilityPickup.gd (Node2D)
- Group `"ability_pickups"`; positioned at tile top-left like other collectibles
- `@export var ability: String` — ability name to grant (e.g. `"push"`)
- `@export var message: String` — text shown in the message overlay on collect (used for non-push abilities)
- Draws a white filled circle (radius 10px) at `(16, 16)` via `_draw()`; hidden after collect
- On collect: grants ability via `GameManager.grant_ability()`, sets `room_entry_positions[current_room]` to player's grid pos, locks player, calls `AbilityTutorial.play_intro(ability, player, main)`
- `reset()` — re-shows pickup (does not revoke ability)

---

### AbilityMessage.gd (CanvasLayer, layer=25)
- Instantiated by Main on `_ready()`; exposed as `main.ability_message`
- Starts hidden (`visible = false`)
- `show_message(text)` — shows overlay immediately; after 2 seconds shows "Press any key to continue..." prompt at the bottom
- Input is only accepted once the prompt is visible; any key/button press dismisses and emits `dismissed`
- `dismissed` signal used by `AbilityPickup` to unlock player movement

---

### AbilityTutorial.gd (autoload singleton, Node)
**Purpose:** Plays per-ability intro animations when an ability pickup is collected. Keeps animation logic decoupled from `AbilityPickup`.

**Key constants:** `ARC_HEIGHT=48`, `SPHERE_DURATION=1.2`, `SPHERE_RADIUS=4`

**Inner class `SphereOverlay` (Node2D):** Temporary node added to the main scene during the push intro. Holds `_spheres: Array` of `{pos: Vector2, done: bool}` entries; draws undone spheres as white circles in `_draw()` via `to_local()`. Freed automatically when all spheres arrive.

**Key functions:**
- `play_intro(ability, player, main)` — dispatches to the correct intro by ability name; for unknown abilities falls back to `AbilityMessage` overlay
- `_play_push_intro(player, main)` — freezes player; finds all PushBlocks (with `has_method("set_highlight")` guard to exclude Nuts) in the current room; spawns a `SphereOverlay`; tweens one sphere per block along a parabolic arc (`sin(t*PI)*ARC_HEIGHT`); on each arrival calls `block.set_highlight(true)`; unlocks player and frees overlay when the last sphere lands
- `_play_chain_intro(player, main)` — same arc animation targeting FloorPanel nodes (group `"floor_panels"`) with `id == "chain1"` in the current room; on arrival calls `panel.set_highlight(true)`; unlocks player when last sphere lands

---

### Utils.gd (autoload singleton, Node)
**Purpose:** Shared helpers used across the project. Currently provides a reusable boss health bar HUD.

**Constants:** `BAR_MARGIN=10`, `BAR_H=16`, `BAR_OUTLINE=2`, `BAR_LAYER=25`

**Key variables:**
- `_bars: Dictionary` — keyed by boss `get_instance_id()`; each entry holds `{canvas, outer, fill, bar_w, particles, shaking}`

**Boss health bar:** `CanvasLayer` (layer 25) with four stacked `ColorRect`s (colored outer frame, black inner frame, black background, colored fill) plus a `CPUParticles2D` at the fill tip. Bar width = viewport width minus `2 × BAR_MARGIN`. Tint color is passed in per update (bosses use `Main.modulate`). Canvas is parented to `Main`, not the boss node, so it survives Y-sort reparenting under `Walls`.

**Key functions:**
- `create_boss_health_bar(boss, main)` — registers a bar for `boss`; call deferred from boss `_ready()` after reparent
- `update_boss_health_bar(boss, hp, max_hp, visible, tint)` — sets visibility, fill ratio, tints particles, and repositions particles to the fill tip
- `shake_boss_health_bar(boss)` — debounced shake: tweens canvas offset ±2px horizontal + random ±2px vertical over ~0.14s, then bursts the tip particles; no-ops if already shaking
- `remove_boss_health_bar(boss)` — frees canvas; call from boss `NOTIFICATION_PREDELETE`

**Boss integration pattern:** `_ready()` → `call_deferred("_register_health_bar")` → `Utils.create_boss_health_bar(self, _main)`; `_process()` → `Utils.update_boss_health_bar(...)`; `_notification(PREDELETE)` → `Utils.remove_boss_health_bar(self)`.

---

### TimedObject.gd (Node2D)
- Positioned at tile top-left; requires a `Sprite2D` child named `"Sprite2D"`
- Tracks how long the player has been in the same room; uses `_was_in_room` edge detection to reset on each entry
- After `APPEAR_TIME = 120.0s` (if `GameManager.has_ability("chain")` is false): shows sprite, starts blinking every `BLINK_INTERVAL = 0.5s`, sets `_main.player.speed_multiplier = 0.8`
- On room exit or re-entry: calls `_hide()` — hides sprite, resets blink state and timer, restores `speed_multiplier = 1.0`
- If chain ability is already granted when the timer would fire, the object stays hidden permanently

---

### AbilityGate.gd (Node2D)
- `@export var required_ability: String = "push"`
- Sprite starts hidden; `_process` shows it as soon as `GameManager.has_ability(required_ability)` returns true
- Uses `TAB.png` sprite (`centered = false`)

---

### TeleportPanel.gd (Node2D)
- Group `"teleport_panels"`; positioned at tile top-left; in `Y_SORT_GROUPS` so Y-sorted under `Walls`
- `@export var panel_name: String` — displayed above the cursor room on the map in teleport mode
- `@export var one_way: bool = false` — if true, excluded from `get_open_teleport_panel_rooms()` (can't be teleported to, only from)
- `OPEN_HOLD_TIME = 0.2s` — player must push against it continuously to open
- Closed: solid (included in `_is_static_solid`); draws `teleport_closed.png` via `_draw()`
- Open: passable; draws `teleport_open.png`; emits `GameManager.shake_requested(8.0)` on open
- `is_player_standing_on(player)` — true when open and player hitbox overlaps panel rect
- `get_grid_pos()`, `get_collision_rect()`, `reset()` — standard tile accessors; reset closes the panel
- Scene has a hidden `Sprite2D` child; drawing is done entirely via `_draw()`

### OnewayPanel (Node2D — uses TeleportPanel.gd)
- Identical to TeleportPanel but `one_way = true` pre-set in scene data (`scenes/OnewayPanel.tscn`)
- Player can open and teleport *from* it; it never appears as a destination in the map menu

---

### MapOverlay.gd (CanvasLayer, layer=10)
**Purpose:** Map/teleport overlay opened by TAB. Slides in/out from the top of the screen (0.15s SINE tween). Mode is determined at open time based on player state.

**Modes:**
- **Teleport mode** — player is on an open TeleportPanel and at least one non-one-way destination exists (`Main.can_teleport_from_panel()`). Cursor navigates between destination rooms; WASD/Arrow keys snap cursor to nearest destination; Space teleports (pressing Space on the player's current room does nothing).
- **Map-only mode** — TAB pressed elsewhere (or no destinations). No cursor, no navigation. Instructions: "TAB: Close"

**Title:** "The Map" is always drawn at the top of the overlay in both modes (replaces the per-panel name that was shown only in teleport mode).

**Key variables:** `_teleport_mode: bool`, `_open_panel_rooms: Array` (destinations only), `_visited: Dictionary`, `_cursor: Vector2i`, `_slide_tween: Tween`, `_pulse_timer: float`, `_pulse_large: bool`, `_space_hint_done: bool`, `_wasd_hint_done: bool`, `_first_two_done: bool`, `_input_delay: float`, `_first_teleport_room: Vector2i`, `_first_teleport_room_set: bool`

**Save/load helpers:** `get_visited()` → duplicate of `_visited`; `set_visited(d)` — replaces `_visited` and redraws if open; both used by SaveManager.

**Hint pulsing:** "Space: Teleport" pulses font size 11↔12 every 0.5s until the player teleports. "WASD/Arrow Keys: Move" pulses the same way until the player teleports to any room that is not `_first_teleport_room`. Both start at large size (`_pulse_large = true`) when the map opens. Pulsing is driven in `_process`; hints are drawn as inline segments so each can have an independent font size.

**First-open delay:** The first time the map opens with ≥2 teleport destinations, all input is blocked for 1 second (`_input_delay = 1.0`). A faint `...` is shown below the instructions during the delay.

**Visual style:** Background is a solid-black box with a tint-colored 2px border. Minimum size is half the viewport (400×192). Box expands to fit the widest of: room grid, instruction text, or panel name text, and expands symmetrically in height if needed. All rooms, connections, stubs, and text drawn in `Main.modulate` tint. Rooms with an open destination panel show a black dot at center. Cursor room has a 1px tint outline. Panel name drawn above rooms; instruction segments drawn inline below, centered as a group. All text uses tint color.

**Connections:** `_has_exit(room, dir)` — checks for at least one non-wall tile on the border. Connections drawn between visited rooms that have an exit between them.

---

---

### SaveManager.gd (autoload singleton)
**Purpose:** Persistent save/load system. Autosaves the active slot every 5 seconds. Reloads the scene when loading to guarantee a clean world state.

**Key constants:** `AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 5.0`, `SAVE_DIR = "user://"`

**Key variables:**
- `active_slot: int` — currently active save slot (1–9); `-1` = none
- `skip_splash: bool` — set `true` before scene reload so `Main._ready()` skips the splash screen
- `_pending_data: Dictionary` — save data waiting to be applied after the reloaded scene is ready
- `_key_doors_opened / _boss_doors_opened / _boss_defeated` — accumulated state for permanently-freed nodes that can't be queried after death

**Input:**
- **1–9**: select slot; loads immediately if file exists, otherwise just activates the slot
- **Shift+1–9**: delete that slot's save file; deactivates slot if it was active

**Save data (JSON at `user://save_slot_N.json`):** player world position, current room, abilities dict, push block/nut grid positions (keyed by `start_grid_pos`), collected keys (by `start_grid_pos`), opened KeyDoors, open TeleportPanels, removed BossDoors, boss defeated flag, enemy positions + dead flags, map visited rooms.

**Load flow:** `load_slot()` → `GameManager.clear_scene_state()` + `reload_current_scene()` → `_process()` detects new scene is ready → `call_deferred("_apply_load", data)` → restores all state silently (no animations/shakes) → calls `Main._update_beam()`.

**Auto-slot mode** (`Player.save_system_enabled = false`): `on_player_ready(false)` activates slot 1 and deferred-loads it if the file exists. Manual mode (`true`): user picks slot with 1–9.

**Notification hooks** (called by game objects before self-destruction):
- `notify_key_door_opened(gp)` — called from `KeyDoor._open()`
- `notify_boss_door_opened(gp)` — called from `BossDoor.open()`
- `notify_boss_defeated()` — called from `WaterBoss._boss_die()`

**Status HUD:** fading top-left Label (layer 50) shown on slot select, load, and delete events.

---

### WallTileMap.gd (TileMapLayer)
**Purpose:** Painted in the Godot editor to define wall tiles. Auto-configures its TileSet in `_ready()`. `y_sort_enabled = true`; parent layer for all Y-sorted gameplay entities (see Y-Sorting).

---

### YSortHitboxBottom.gd (class_name)
**Purpose:** Shared math for Player and Prong hitbox-bottom Y-sort layout.

- `SPRITE_OFFSET` — `Vector2(-16, -16)`
- `read_hitbox(hitbox)` → `{half_w, half_h, offset}`
- `body_offset_from_hitbox(offset, half_h)` → `Vector2(0, -(offset.y + half_h))`
- `hitbox_center_from_root(root_pos, body_offset, hitbox_offset)`
- `root_pos_from_hitbox_center(center, body_offset, hitbox_offset)`

---

### Enemy.gd (Node2D)
**Purpose:** Enemy that slowly walks toward the player in a straight line, blocked by walls and solids, killed by the electric beam, and resets the room on player contact.

**Constants:** `SPEED=40.0 px/s`, `SPRITE_SPEED=20.0`, `CONTACT_DIST=14.0`, `BEAM_RADIUS=14.0`, `TILE_SIZE=32`, `CONTACT_EPS=0.1`

**Hitbox:** 20×20, offset `(6, 6)` from position (slightly inset from the 32×32 sprite). Used for AABB wall collision via `Main.get_player_blocking_rects()`.

**Sprite lag:** `_visual_pos` lerps toward `position` each frame; `_sprite.position = _visual_pos - position` applies the lag offset. When pushed by a block, `position` teleports instantly while `_visual_pos` slides to catch up.

**Key functions:**
- `get_center()` → `position + Vector2(16, 16)`
- `_move_x(dx)` / `_move_y(dy)` — axis-separated AABB movement against `Main.get_player_blocking_rects()`
- `push(dir)` — displaces `position` by `dir * TILE_SIZE`; sprite lag produces the slide visual
- `_die()` — hides sprite, fires particle burst (`one_shot=true`, `explosiveness=1.0` set in `_ready()`); enemy stays dead until `reset()` is called
- `reset()` — restores position, visual pos, sprite visibility; called by `Main._reset_room()` and `Main._transition_to_room()`
- `_eject_from_solid()` — BFS from current tile outward; teleports `position` (and snaps `_visual_pos`) to the nearest tile where the hitbox doesn't intersect any solid; no-ops if already clear

**Reset triggers:** room restart (R / player contact), room entry (transition to the enemy's room).

**Group:** `"enemies"`; in `Y_SORT_GROUPS` so reparented under `Walls` at startup.

## Puzzle Logic Flow

```
Player presses Space:
  → Main.spawn_prong(player.get_body_center())
      if 2 prongs exist: clear both (Prong.apply_clear_shrink), deactivate beam, return
      else: place prong under Walls tilemap → _update_beam():
          → _compute_beam_path() via nuts
          → set GameManager.beam_blocked, call evaluate_puzzle()
          → activate or deactivate beam; flash blocking blockers
          → evaluate_puzzle(): each prong checked via _panel_id_near (20px radius)

Player presses R:
  → lock player → ResetEffect.play()
  → static fades in (0.28s) → holds at 100% (0.2s) → peaked signal
  → peaked: delete room prongs, reset push blocks, reset key doors/keys, reset enemies, teleport player
  → static fades out (0.22s) → done signal → unlock player

Room transition (player walks to edge):
  → clear prongs instantly → reset enemies in new room → camera tweens 0.25s → player locked during tween

Enemy touches player:
  → _reset_room() triggered (same as pressing R)

Enemy enters beam:
  → enemy hides sprite, plays one-shot particle burst; stays dead until room reset or re-entry
```

## Camera System

- One room fills the 800×384 viewport
- `Camera2D` initialized to `_room_center(0,0)` in `_ready()`
- **Shake:** decays via `lerpf(..., 0, 20*delta)`; triggered on prong events (5–6 strength), door open (5), block push (0.8)
- **Room transition:** 0.25s tween on `Camera2D.position` (EASE_IN_OUT SINE)
- `CAMERA_MARGIN` of `(16, 16)` added to all room center calculations
- No lean or zoom effects
